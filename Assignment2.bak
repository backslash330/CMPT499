; Question 3
;Theorem: Let e be a LcExp as defined by definition 1.1.8

;Proof: This proof is by induction on the structure of e where e is an element of LcExp.

;Induction Hypothesis(IH): For any an element of LcExp they will always have the same number of left and right parentheses.

;Inductive proof: we must prove that e has a balanced number of left and right parenthese for the base case and we then prove that this holds true for all other elements of LcExp.

;Base Case: If e is an Identifier then there are no parentheses which means they are balanced.

;Based on Definition 1.1.8 there are a number of cases we need to look at to prove that our brackets hold for all elements of LcExp

;	1) The element can be in the form (lambda (Identifier) LcExp) then by definition the outer expression has the same number of left and right parentheses. We proved in the base case that an identifier has no parentheses, so we have matching there as well. Finally the subexpression LcExp will have balanced if it is an Idenfiter, as previously shown, or if it is in the form  (lambda (Identifier) LcExp) . We will also show that it will be balanced in the form (LcExp LcExp)
;	2) The element can be in the form (LcExp LcExp). This outer form has a balanced number of left and right parentheses. If the inner LcExp's must be in the base case, the form (lambda (Identifier) LcExp) or the form (LcExp LcExp). Since we have shown that each of these forms have a balanced number of parentheses then regardless of the combination of LcExp and LcExp that the element has the same number of left and right parentheses.

;Therefore we have shown that for every element of LcExp the number of left and right parentheses will be balanced. 


; Question 4
(define (product sos1 sos2)
  (cond
    [(not (list? sos1)) (error "product: first argument must be a list, but is " sos1)]
    [(not (list? sos2)) (error "product: second argument must be a list, but is " sos2)]
    [(or (null? sos1) (null? sos2)) '()]
    [else (apply append (map (lambda (x) (map (lambda (y) (list x y)) sos2)) sos1))]))


; Question 5

; Question 6 THIS FUNCTION NEEDS ERROR CHECKING
(define (list-index pred lst)
  (define (list-index-helper pred lst index)
    (cond ((null? lst) #f) 
          ((pred (car lst)) index) 
          (else (list-index-helper pred (cdr lst) (+ index 1)))))
  
  (cond ((not (procedure? pred)) (error "pred must be a procedure"))
        ((not (list? lst)) (error "lst must be a list"))
        ((number? (list-index-helper pred lst 0)) (list-index-helper pred lst 0))
        (else #f)))


; Question 7
(define (path n bst)
  (cond
    ; error check to ensure the data is correct
    [(not (list? bst)) (error "path: second argument must be a list, but is " bst)]
    [(not (number? n)) (error "path: first argument must be a number, but is " n)]
    ; if the list is null, then we return #f
    [(null? bst) (error "path: No path can be found to " n)]
    ; if the list is not null, then we check the first element of the list
    ; if the first element is equal to n, then we return an empty list
    [(= (car bst) n) '()]
    ; if the first element is not equal to n, then we check if the first element is greater than n
    ; if the first element is greater than n, then we return a list with left and we call path on the left subtree
    ; if the first element is less than n, then we return a list with right and we call path on the right subtree
    [else (if (> (car bst) n) (cons 'left (path n (cadr bst))) (cons 'right (path n (caddr bst))))]
  )
